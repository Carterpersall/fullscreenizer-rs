# What is this?
Fullscreenizer is a small tool to force a game into a borderless windowed fullscreen
mode (remove the border from a game's window and resize it to cover the entire monitor).

Strongly inspired by the app of the same name by Kostas "Bad Sector" Michalopoulos. You can find the original program [here](http://runtimeterror.com/tools/fullscreenizer/). 

# Why would I need this?
Using fullscreen mode in some games can cause issues with multiple monitors or when alt-tabbing, some old games don't support the full resolution of modern monitors, and a plethora of other issues. Borderless windowed fullscreen mode is a good alternative that solves most of these problems, but not all games support it.
